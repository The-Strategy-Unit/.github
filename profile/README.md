# The Strategy Unit

The Strategy Unit is a specialist NHS team. We produce high-quality, multi-disciplinary analytical work â€“ and we help people apply the results.
Our proposition is simple: better evidence, better decisions, better outcomes.

We believe in what we do. So we partner with others who share our aims.
We help drive the [Midlands Decision Support Network](https://www.midlandsdecisionsupport.nhs.uk/);
[we support the NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/);
we have a strategic partnership with [Ipsos](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk);
we are part of [Midlands and Lancashire CSU](https://www.midlandsandlancashirecsu.nhs.uk/) and we work closely with our sister team: the [Health Economics Unit](https://healtheconomicsunit.nhs.uk/).
