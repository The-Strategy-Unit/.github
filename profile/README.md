# The Strategy Unit

We are a specialist NHS team producing high-quality, multi-disciplinary analytical work. This repository hosts the code underpinning our projects.

## Why is our code open?

We are public servants, providing public services.

The Strategy Unit is therefore committed to maximising public value for the work we do. One significant route to this is disseminating our outputs.

This might mean models, underpinning code, presentations, reports: anything that usefully communicates the approaches we've used and the results we've arrived at.

Others can then learn from, build upon, adapt and reuse what we have done - in a way that would not be possible if outputs were not made public.

So, our default approach is to share our work, through our website, our GitHub, through social media, and other channels.
